Power spectrum and particle production in a bouncing cosmology 

Hello everyone:

Here is a small timeline of events that I will try to follow:
- In the preliminary stages, I will be gathering all the plots needed to start the production (Approx: 1 week (?)).
- As soon as I get most of the plots, I'll start writing it up (Starting on November 3rd)... expect the first .tex
file available by the day after. 


Please feel free to comment, discuss and modify anything that you consider relevant. I suggest following the convention 
'Lastname-date.tex' each time a file gets modified. If you feel there's (reasonable) room for improvement, please proceed 
and share your progress with everyone!

Cheers from your bouncing Admin...
