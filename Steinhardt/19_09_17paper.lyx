\begin_layout Abstract
We study a recently
\emph on
 
\emph default
proposed new cosmological phase where a scalar field moves periodically
 in an expanding spatially-flat Friedmann universe.
 This phase corresponds to a limit cycle of the equations of motion and
 can be considered as a cosmological realization of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time-crystal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We show that this phase is only possible, provided the Null Energy Condition
 is violated and the so-called Phantom Divide is crossed.
 We prove that in general k-essence models: i) this crossing causes infinite
 growth of quantum perturbations on short scales, and ii) exactly periodic
 solutions are only possible, provided the limit cycle encircles a singularity
 in the phase plane.
 The configurations neighboring this singular curve in the phase space are
 linearly unstable on one side of the curve and superluminal on the other
 side.
 Moreover, the increment of the instability is infinitely growing for each
 mode by approaching the singularity, while for the configurations on the
 other side, the sound speed is growing without limit.
 We illustrate our general results by analytical and numerical studies of
 a particular class of such k-essence models.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually the appearance of a periodic structure in space is attributed to
 formation of ordinary crystals.
 By analogy, the authors of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shapere:2012nq"

\end_inset

 suggested to use the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time-crystals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the systems with vacuum solutions which are exactly periodic in time.
 In cosmology such vacuum solutions can be interesting in context of Dark
 Energy and early stages of Inflation.
 On the quantum level this idea was further elaborated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wilczek:2012jt"

\end_inset

.
 However, a cosmological expansion usually works as a friction and dissipates
 energy, so that an exactly periodic motion is impossible.
 Indeed, a usual system will finally approach an equilibrium static configuratio
n with minimal energy density.
 However, in some non-canonical cases, the lowest possible available configurati
on can still be non-static and correspond to a motion.
 In particular, this is the case for the ghost condensate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ArkaniHamed:2003uy"

\end_inset

.
 This is also the basis for the original k-inflation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ArmendarizPicon:1999rj"

\end_inset

 attractor.
 Thus the solution with the lowest energy level can spontaneously break
 the time-translation invariance.
 Due to the shift-symmetry of the ghost condensate, this spontaneous symmetry
 breaking still results there in the time-independent and Lorentz-invariant
 energy momentum tensor (EMT).
 The latter corresponds to the normal de Sitter vacuum with some cosmological
 constant.
 It is rather interesting to consider wether one can spontaneously break
 time-translational invariance even on the level of the EMT so that the
 vacuum configuration is different from the de Sitter spacetime.
 Here we mean that this non-trivial solution should be valid for very long
 times up to the asymptotic future.
 In particular, if the motion in this vacuum state is periodic, with the
 period 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

, then the continuous time translation invariance, 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+c$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 real, is only broken to the level of a discrete subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+n\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is an integer.
 The recent work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bains:2015gpv"

\end_inset

 proposed an interesting new phase of cosmological matter with these properties.
 In this phase a scalar field periodically moves in the constantly expanding
 universe.
 This oscillatory phase was realized by a non-canonical scalar field theory
 of the k-essence type 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ArmendarizPicon:1999rj,ArmendarizPicon:2000ah,ArmendarizPicon:2000dh,Chiba:1999ka"

\end_inset

, see the next section for details.
 A similar idea of an oscillating dark energy was studied in e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Feng:2004ff,Nojiri:2006ww"

\end_inset

.
 While quasi-periodic oscillations and their finite duration in non-minimally
 coupled scalar-tensor theories with a canonical kinetic term were considered
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Arefeva:2012sqa,Skugoreva:2014gka,Pozdeeva:2016cja"

\end_inset

.
 On top of that a periodically evolving universe with the positive spatial
 curvature was in the focus of the works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Harrison:1967zz,1990MNRAS.243..252K"

\end_inset

.
 Later in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dabrowski:1995ae,Graham:2011nb"

\end_inset

 it was showed that these solutions can be realized by a canonical scalar
 field with negative potential.
 In this paper we discuss weather it is possible to realize a time-crystal
 in a spatially-flat cosmological setup with a minimally coupled k-essence.

\begin_layout Section
NEC violation is needed for a limit cycle 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A presence of exactly periodic motion with the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

, in particular, requires that the energy density is periodic 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\left(t+\mathcal{T}\right)=\varepsilon\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the energy density was decreasing, then somewhere between 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 the energy density should start to increase to compensate this reduction.
 And vice versa: for the originally increasing energy density there should
 be a moment between 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 where the energy density should start to decrease.
 Thus anyway during each cycle there are time intervals on which the energy
 density is growing and on which it is decreasing.
 Further, the conservation of energy in a Friedmann universe requires 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\varepsilon}=-3H\left(\varepsilon+p\right)\,,\label{eq:energy_conservation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the Hubble parameter and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the effective pressure of the oscillatory matter.
 Hence, in an expanding universe (with 
\begin_inset Formula $H>0$
\end_inset

) the energy density can grow, only if the effective enthalpy density 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon+p$
\end_inset

 is negative.
 The negative sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon+p$
\end_inset

 implies a violations of the Null Energy Condition (NEC) which states that
 for all null vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 the energy-momentum tensor should satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu}n^{\nu}\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 In turn, a violation of the NEC necessarily implies that the Hamiltonian
 density of the system is unbounded from below - for each constant there
 are such local values of the initial data that the energy density is more
 negative than this constant, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sawicki:2012pz"

\end_inset

.
 In other words a violation of NEC implies that the system has to possess
 configurations with arbitrary negative energy densities.
 For a recent discussion of NEC violation see e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rubakov:2014jja"

\end_inset

.
 Clearly, in a collapsing universe, a decrease in energy density would require
 an NEC violation as well.
 In cosmology, matter which violates NEC is often referred to as Phantom

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the time derivative of the energy density can change
 the sign, provided 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 changes sign.
 In this case the spatially-flat Friedmann universe has to be able to evolve
 from expansion to contraction and then from contraction to expansion.
 The latter transition corresponds to a bounce.
 It is well known that a bounce of a spatially-flat Friedmann universe requires
 a violation of NEC.
 Indeed, the transition from contraction to expansion at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{b}$
\end_inset

 requires 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(t_{b}\right)=\dot{a}/a=0$
\end_inset

.
 Using the Friedmann equations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H^{2}=\frac{1}{3}\varepsilon\,,\label{eq:Friedmann_1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Except of the last section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 we use the reduced Planck units with 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\text{Pl}}=\left(8\pi G_{\text{N}}\right)^{-1/2}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{H}=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\varepsilon+p\right)\,,\label{eq:Friedmann_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

we obtain that at transition from contraction with 
\begin_inset Formula $H<0$
\end_inset

 to expansion with 
\begin_inset Formula $H>0$
\end_inset

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{H}>0$
\end_inset

 and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon+p<0$
\end_inset

 so that NEC is violated again.
 Hence we conclude that a violation of NEC is necessary to realize an exactly
 periodic oscillatory cosmological phase.
 Moreover, due to the periodicity the system should be able to evolve through
 the so-called Phantom Divide (PD) - the border of the NEC-violating region.
 This border corresponds to the equation of state parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $w=p/\varepsilon=-1$
\end_inset

.
 The dynamical transition through 
\begin_inset Formula $w=-1$
\end_inset

 should cyclicly happen in both directions from above and from below.

 Below in the next section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 we will refresh some basic facts about k-essence and provide simple arguments
 against a smooth transition of a k-essence field through the Phantom Divide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally it is useful to consider the average of 
\begin_inset Formula $w+1$
\end_inset

 over some time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $T=t_{f}-t_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:energy_conservation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Friedmann_1"

\end_inset

 under the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon>0$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{f}$
\end_inset

 we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle w\left(t\right)+1\right\rangle _{T}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}dt\left(1+w\left(t\right)\right)=-\frac{1}{T}\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}dt\frac{\dot{\varepsilon}}{\varepsilon\sqrt{3\varepsilon}}=\frac{1}{T}\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon\left(t_{f}\right)}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon\left(t_{i}\right)}}\right)\,.
\]

\end_inset

If the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is a multiple of the period of oscillations 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle w\left(t\right)+1\right\rangle _{T}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus such an oscillatory stage can be interesting to model inflation and
 dark energy.

\begin{equation}
X=\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\varphi_{,\mu}\varphi_{,\nu}\,.\label{eq:X}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In cosmological applications the field is only slightly inhomogeneous and
 anisotropic so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{,\mu}$
\end_inset

 is timelike, hence throughout the paper we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $X>0$
\end_inset

, as our signature convention 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(+,-,-,-\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This class of theories was introduced in

 (see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 The corresponding EMT is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu}=p_{,X}\varphi_{,\mu}\varphi_{,\nu}-pg_{\mu\nu}\,,\label{eq:EMT_General}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

for every timelike 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{,\mu}$
\end_inset

 this EMT takes a form of a perfect fluid 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu}=\left(\varepsilon+p\right)u_{\mu}u_{\nu}-pg_{\mu\nu}\,,\label{eq:EMT_Fluid}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

u_{\mu}=\frac{\varphi_{,\mu}}{\sqrt{2X}}\,,\label{eq:Velocity}

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and the energy density 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=2Xp_{,X}-p.\label{eq:Energy_density}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence for all null vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu}n^{\nu}=p_{,X}\left(\varphi_{,\mu}n^{\mu}\right)^{2}=\frac{\varepsilon+p}{2X}\left(\varphi_{,\mu}n^{\mu}\right)^{2}\,.\label{eq:NEC_k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The Null Energy Condition requires 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu}n^{\nu}\geq0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,X}\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus to change the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}n^{\mu}n^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 the system has to change the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,X}$
\end_inset

 or for time-like derivatives to change the sign of the enthalpy density
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon+p$

 In particular, if the transition is smooth, then at the Phantom Divide

\end{equation}

The positivity of the right hand side of the expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 guaranties that this equation of motion is a hyperbolic quasilinear PDE.
 Note that hyperbolicity guaranties that Cauchy problem is well posed and
 evolution is predictable till some moment of time.
 However, it was demonstrated that breakdown of predictability due to the
 formation of caustics is a rather generic phenomenon, see recent discussion
 in

Most recently it was speculated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that k-essence could be UV completed by a canonical complex scalar U(1)

 This UV completion would eliminates the formation of caustics as a problem.

 In cosmology the equation of motion reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{,X}\ddot{\varphi}+3H\dot{\varphi}p_{,X}+\varepsilon_{,\varphi}=0\,,\label{eq:equation_of_motion_cosmology}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is given by the first Friedmann equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Friedmann_1"

\end_inset

 with the energy density 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Energy_density"

\end_inset

.
 Instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}$
\end_inset

 one can use 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 as independent variables.
 In this case the Jacobian is 
\begin_inset Formula $J=p_{,\varphi}\varepsilon_{,\dot{\varphi}}-\varepsilon_{,\varphi}p_{,\dot{\varphi}}$
\end_inset

.
 The dynamical equation on energy density is 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:energy_conservation"

\end_inset

 with the Hubble parameter given by the first Friedmann equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Friedmann_1"

\end_inset

.
 While the dynamical equation for the pressure is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{p}=-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{,X}}\left(6XHp_{,X}^{2}+p_{,\varphi}\varepsilon_{,\dot{\varphi}}-\varepsilon_{,\varphi}p_{,\dot{\varphi}}\right)\,,\label{eq:derivative_of_pressure}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the Hubble parameter is expressed through the energy density by the
 first Friedmann equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Friedmann_1"

\end_inset

 and all other quantities should be expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varepsilon,p\right)$
\end_inset

 using implicit function theorem.
 Unfortunately this description is only valid outside of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}=0$
\end_inset

 line.
 Indeed, the Jacobian can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J=p_{,\varphi}\varepsilon_{,\dot{\varphi}}-\varepsilon_{,\varphi}p_{,\dot{\varphi}}=\dot{\varphi}\left(p_{,\varphi}\varepsilon_{,X}-\varepsilon_{,\varphi}p_{,X}\right)\,,
\]

\end_inset

where the right hand side is vanishing on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}=0$
\end_inset

 line.
 However, if a limit cycle exists, it has to cross this line.
 Thus the Jacobian is not sign-definite and it is not clear whether the
 expression in the brackets of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:derivative_of_pressure"

\end_inset

 is sign-definite.
 For a shift-symmetric case (with the symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi\rightarrow\varphi+c$
\end_inset

) the pressure evolves due to the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:energy_conservation"

\end_inset

.
 In this case a limit cycle is not possible in an expanding universe, because
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}p_{,X}\propto a^{-3}$
\end_inset

 so that

However, the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological dynamics of a k-essence
 scalar field driving the expansion of the universe cannot be brought to
 this simple two dimensional canonical form.
 Below, in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, using standard results from the theory of ODE, we prove that the changing
 of sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 is a necessary condition for the existence of cosmological limit cycles.
 Hence one has to require that on some configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$

 But, for a generic k-essence Lagrangian, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$
\end_inset

 does not imply 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,X}=0$

 Therefore, for 
\begin_inset Formula $X>0$

 and a finite and non-vanishing 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,X}$

 the singular surface where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the divergent speed of sound for the perturbations 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}^{2}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 changes sign (as required for the existence of a limit cycle) it implies
 that on one side of the singular hypersurface there is a region of extreme
 superluminality, while the configurations on the other side suffer from
 infinitely strong gradient instabilities.
 On these latter configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}^{2}<0$
\end_inset

 and the equation of motion 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Thus generically these

 k-essence systems require existence of configurations with an infinitely

 An effective action in gravity should contain the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\partial R\right)^{2}$

 In this case the hypersurface of constant time coincides with the characteristi

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 is the conformal time and the curvature perturbation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}$
\end_inset

 is constructed out of the perturbation of the k-essence field 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\varphi$
\end_inset

 and the Newtonian potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}=\Phi+H\frac{\delta\varphi}{\dot{\varphi}}\,,\label{eq:curvature_perturbation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where both perturbations are written in terms of gauge-invariant variables
 which correspond to the Newtonian gage.
 Finally the normalization is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z=a^{2}\left(\frac{\varepsilon+p}{c_{\text{S}}^{2}H^{2}}\right)=\varepsilon_{,X}\left(\frac{\dot{\varphi}a}{H}\right)^{2}\,.\label{eq:Normalization}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The action is ghosty provided 
\begin_inset Formula $Z<0$
\end_inset

 which is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}<0$
\end_inset

.
 If NEC is violated, but there are no gradient instabilities so that the
 system is hyperbolic and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}^{2}>0$
\end_inset

, then necessarily 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}<0$
\end_inset

 and the action is ghosty.
 Ghost instabilities are perturbative, but rely on interactions with other
 fields.
 In particular there is always an interaction through gravity.
 On the contrary the gradient instabilities are linear short scale instabilities.

 For example it is the case in the example provided in

 Even if we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}$
\end_inset

 remains nonzero and does not blow up one would need to guaranty that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,\varphi}/\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 does not blow up.
 However, in that case 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,\varphi}$
\end_inset

 should vanish at the same point where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 is vanishing.
 This provides two equations in the phase space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}\right)$
\end_inset

 to satisfy.
 Therefore this can generically only happen on isolated points of the measure
 zero corresponding to extrema of the energy density.
 This degenerate case was in details discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Another crucial point is that at the Phantom Divide with non-vanishing
 speed of sound the normalization factor 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is vanishing.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to an infinitely strong coupling on all scales at for the QFT
 of perturbations.
 Indeed, the cubic terms in the action for perturbations contain higher
 order derivatives of the background quantities and are not vanishing at
 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=0$
\end_inset

.
 A QFT which only contains third order operators is strongly coupled on
 all scales.

\]

\end_inset

The canonical variable can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v=a\sqrt{\left|\varepsilon_{,X}\right|}\left(\delta\varphi+\Phi\frac{\dot{\varphi}}{H}\right)\,.\label{eq:canonical_longer}

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\mbox{sign}\left(\varepsilon_{,X}\right)$

 The corresponding dispersion relation is 
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $-z''/z$
\end_inset

 plays the role of the square of effective time-dependent mass.
 Positive 
\begin_inset Formula $z''/z$

 neglect expansion of spacetime.
 This mass is infinitely growing (in the positive or negative direction)
 at the Phantom Divide with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$

 Clearly this does not allow to separate scales and treat the perturbations
 as an EFT.

Another problem is rooted in the speed of sound.
 Let's now assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}>0$
\end_inset

 at the Phantom Divide.
 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}^{2}\left(t_{pd}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and by continuity 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 changes sign at this point.
 This change of sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 implies the transition of the equation of motion 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:covariant_equation_of_motion"

\end_inset

 from the hyperbolic to the elliptic type of PDE or vice versa.
 It is well known that the Cauchy problem is ill-posed for elliptical PDE's.
 The problem is in the short wavelength instabilities behaving as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\varphi_{\mathbf{k}}\sim\exp\left(\left|c_{\text{S}}\mathbf{k}\right|t\right)\,,\label{eq:grrowth}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that the increment of instability in mode 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|c_{\text{S}}\mathbf{k}\right|$
\end_inset

 and grows for large wave numbers without any bound.
 In reality the bound is provided by a lattice size or by the strong coupling
 scale.
 In both these cases the instability has a characteristic scale corresponding
 to the cut off scale completely destroying the predictability of the theory.
 If a system enters the elliptic regime on a classical solution which is
 in the formal region of validity of the EFT, than the system stays there
 much longer than the inverse frequency cut off scale.
 In that case all physical modes get a tremendous exponential amplification

It is worth looking at the quantum fluctuations to understand the problem.
 If we start from a healthy background 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}^{2}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}>0$
\end_inset

, then in a Hadamard state (short scales vacuum state) the mode functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 for the canonical variable 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 are normalized inside the horizon (for scales 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}k\ll\left|z''/z\right|$
\end_inset

) as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|v_{k}\right|=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{\omega_{k}}}\simeq\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{c_{\text{S}}k}}\,.\label{eq:mode_func_norm}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where we have explicitly written 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar$
\end_inset

 to stress the quantum origin of this quantity.
 Then the characteristic quantum fluctuation of the canonical variable on
 scale 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta v_{k}\sim\sqrt{\hbar}\left|v_{k}\right|k^{3/2}\sim\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{c_{\text{S}}}}\,k\,.\label{eq:fluctuations}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

On these ultrashort physical length scales 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell=a/k$
\end_inset

 we can neglect the fluctuations of the Newtonian potential (see below)
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\varphi_{\ell}\sim\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{\varepsilon_{,X}c_{\text{S}}}}\left(\frac{k}{a}\right)=\left(\frac{\hbar^{2}}{\varepsilon_{,X}p_{,X}}\right)^{1/4}\cdot\frac{1}{\ell}=\left(\frac{2X\hbar^{2}}{\varepsilon_{,X}\left(\varepsilon+p\right)}\right)^{1/4}\cdot\frac{1}{\ell}\,.\label{eq:field_quantum_fluctuation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here we assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\gg L_{UV}$
\end_inset

, where the latter is the UV-cutoff length scale which is typically present
 in such derivatively coupled theories.
 Thus if either of the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,X}$
\end_inset

 is vanishing, the quantum fluctuations 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\varphi_{\ell}$
\end_inset

 blow up on short scales.
 In particular, for 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\text{S}}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 quantum fluctuations at every given scale 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 inside the horizon blow up and completely invalidate the applicability
 of the whole theory of cosmological perturbations.

On the other hand the fluctuations of the Newtonian potential on short scales

 Another possibility is to try more general theories with one degree of
 freedom but with covariant HD in the total action.

 instabilities was followed in

The cosmological equation of motion

\end_inset

For every k-essence with the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}\right)$
\end_inset

 it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary system of ODE 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \frac{du}{dt}=\alpha\left(u,v\right)=-p_{,u}\sqrt{3\varepsilon}-\varepsilon_{,v}\,,\label{eq:auxiliarly_system}\\
 & \frac{dv}{dt}=\beta\left(u,v\right)=\varepsilon_{,u}\,,\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=up_{,u}-p$
\end_inset

.
 Without the friction term 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,u}\sqrt{3\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 these ODEs are the Hamilton equations of motion with canonical momentum
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

, coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Without this friction term the motion happens on the curves of constant
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,u}=up_{,X}$
\end_inset

, the effective friction coefficient is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,X}\sqrt{3\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

.
 If the sign of the friction coefficient is always positive the dissipative
 motion cannot be periodic.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,X}$
\end_inset

 has to change the sign for the existence of a limit cycle.
 This is a reformulation of the same statement presented in at the beginning
 of the paper.
 This system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxiliarly_system"

\end_inset

 is different from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:equation_of_motion_cosmology"

, but it is constructed out of the same function 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}\right)$
\end_inset

 where instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 one plugs in 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}$
\end_inset

 one plugs in 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
 The solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $u\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 are different from 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{v}\neq u$
\end_inset

.
 The main point is that this system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxiliarly_system"

\end_inset

 has the same integral curves on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v,u\right)$

LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:equation_of_motion_cosmology"

\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}\right)$
\end_inset

, but it is clearly less singular.
 These integral curves are locally given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:integral_curves"

\end_inset

.
 In particular a limit cycle corresponds to a closed integral curve on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}\right)$
\end_inset

 plane and on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v,u\right)$
\end_inset

 Тhe time flow in

\begin_layout Subsection
Nontrivial fixed points
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Nontrivial-fixed-points"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the friction, one can expect, that the (non-degenerate) fixed
 points of the system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxiliarly_system"

\end_inset

 should always be saddles, nodes and foci.
 However, nontrivial fixed points with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$
\end_inset

 can only be either saddles or centers.
 Let us prove this statement.
 Note that these fixed points of the auxiliary system are located on the
 singular curve of the original system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:first_order_system_norm"

\end_inset

.
 Around a generic fixed point
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\delta v=\varepsilon_{,uu}\delta u+\varepsilon_{,uv}\delta v\,,
\]

\end_inset

and for a nontrivial fixed point at which 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\delta u=-\left[p_{,uv}\sqrt{3G_{\text{N}}\varepsilon}+\frac{3G_{\text{N}}}{2}p_{,u}\frac{\varepsilon_{,v}}{\sqrt{3G_{\text{N}}\varepsilon}}+\varepsilon_{,vv}\right]\delta v-\varepsilon_{,vu}\delta u\,,
\]

\end_inset

where we have used 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,u}=\varepsilon_{,X}u=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,uu}=\left(up_{,X}\right)_{,u}=p_{,X}+2Xp_{,XX}=\varepsilon_{,X}=0$
\end_inset

.
 If we further use 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left(u,v\right)=-p_{,u}\sqrt{3G_{\text{N}}\varepsilon}-\varepsilon_{,v}=0$
\end_inset

, the last equation takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\delta u=p_{,u}\left[\frac{3}{2}G_{\text{N}}p_{,u}-\left(\frac{\varepsilon_{,v}}{p_{,u}}\right)_{,v}\right]\delta v-\varepsilon_{,vu}\delta u\,.
\]

\end_inset

Hence for the eigenvalues of the linearized system we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda^{2}=\varepsilon_{,uv}^{2}+\varepsilon_{,uu}p_{,u}\left[\frac{3}{2}G_{\text{N}}p_{,u}-\left(\frac{\varepsilon_{,v}}{p_{,u}}\right)_{,v}\right]\,.\label{eq:Nontrivial_Eigenvalue}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These eigenvalues are either both real and of opposite sign, so that the
 fixed point is a saddle, or both eigenvalues are purely imaginary so that
 the fixed point is a center in the linear approximation.
 Thus a fixed point on the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$
\end_inset

 cannot be a node.
 By virtue of the Lyapunov theorem, for a fixed point to be an exact center,
 a nonlinear system has to posses an analytic non-trivial integral of motion
 around this fixed point.
 The latter requirement is rather strong and can only be realized in special
 cases.
 Hence one can expect that the center in linear approximation should become
 a non-linear focus.

The Bendixson–Dulac theorem

\begin_layout Standard
This theorem states that, if there exist a

\end_inset

 function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

 (called the Dulac function) such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\left(f\alpha\right)}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial\left(f\beta\right)}{\partial v}>0\,,
\]

\end_inset

almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then there
 are no periodic solutions lying entirely within the region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further we will assume that in the region where of phase space where the
 limit cycle is located the energy density is strictly positive, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon>0$
\end_inset

.
 This is needed for the differentiability of the right hand side of the
 system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxiliarly_system"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, this excludes a possibility of a bounce happening in this region
 of phase space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case one can chose the Dulac function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\varepsilon\right)=1/\sqrt{3\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 for which we have
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is important to stress the power of the Dulac generalization of the original
 Bendixson theorem which only allowed for 
\begin_inset Formula $f=1$
\end_inset

.
 In that case one would obtain that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}\left(3\varepsilon+p\right)$
\end_inset

 should change the sign for the existence of the limit cycle.
 This is clearly a weaker requirement.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\left(f\alpha\right)}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial\left(f\beta\right)}{\partial v}=\left(-f\left(\varepsilon\right)p_{,u}\sqrt{3\varepsilon}\right)_{,u}=-\varepsilon_{,X}\,,
\]

\end_inset

where we have used that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,uu}=\left(up_{,X}\right)_{,u}=p_{,X}+2Xp_{,XX}=\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the system should necessary possess a singularity where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 changes sign or at least vanishing.
 Otherwise the limit cycle cannot exist.
 This goes beyond the statement that the limit cycle should have a fixed
 point of the system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxiliarly_system"

\end_inset

 inside.
 Indeed, for a fixed point 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,u}=\varepsilon_{,X}u$
\end_inset

 should vanish.
 The latter is always realized at the origin where 
\begin_inset Formula $u=0$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the change of sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 is a strong requirement for the existence of a limit cycle.
 It is not clear whether this condition can be obtained just form the requiremen
t that the sign of the time-derivative of the pressure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:derivative_of_pressure"

\end_inset

 should change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cosmocanonical equations 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 does not correspond to a naive 
\emph on
flat space
\emph default
 canonical momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=\partial\mathscr{L}/\partial\dot{\varphi}=p_{,\dot{\varphi}}=P/a^{3}$
\end_inset

 for the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, for this momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 we obtain using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:equation_of_motion_cosmology"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\pi}=-3H\pi+\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\varphi}\right)_{\dot{\varphi}}\,,\label{eq:fake_canonical}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 instead of the first equation of the auxiliary system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxiliarly_system"

\end_inset

.
 From this equation above it follows that on the limit cycle the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,\varphi}$
\end_inset

 (taken by constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}$
\end_inset

) should change the sign.
 Thus a limit cycle crosses the curve on phase space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi,\dot{\varphi}\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{,\varphi}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, otherwise it is impossible to overcome the Hubble friction and
 the
\emph on
 flat space
\emph default
 canonical momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 would always decrease in an expanding universe.
 Note that the transition to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is not that useful in the region with a singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}=0$
\end_inset

, as there the relation between momentum and field velocity becomes not
 invertible, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:invertability"

\end_inset

.
 Thus this description would not be useful to prove the statement that this
 singularity is required for a limit cycle.
 Now we can look at the 
\emph on
flat space
\emph default
 Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}=\dot{\varphi}\pi-p\,.\label{eq:another_Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Clearly this Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:another_Hamiltonian"

\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 by value, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}\left(\varphi,\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 are two different functions.
 Further using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\varphi}\right)_{\pi}=\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\varphi}\right)_{\dot{\varphi}}+\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\dot{\varphi}}\right)_{\varphi}\left(\frac{\partial\dot{\varphi}}{\partial\varphi}\right)_{\pi}\,,
\]

\end_inset

we get that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\varphi}\right)_{\dot{\varphi}}=-\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial\varphi}\right)_{\pi}\,,
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:fake_canonical"

\end_inset

 differs from the canonical equation by a friction term with
\emph on
 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $3H=\sqrt{3\mathcal{H}}$
\end_inset

 friction coefficient.
 The first order equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 does not have the friction term and remains canonical 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\varphi}=\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial\pi}\right)_{\varphi}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Contrary to the auxiliary system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxiliarly_system"

\end_inset

 the trajectories in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi,\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 are not identical to the integral curves of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:equation_of_motion_cosmology"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can start from the system 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \dot{\pi}=-\sqrt{3\mathcal{H}}\,\pi-\mathcal{H}_{,\varphi}\,,\label{eq:almoust_Hamilton_equations}\\
 & \dot{\varphi}=\mathcal{H}_{,\pi}\,,\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

and use the Bendixson–Dulac theorem with the Dulac function 
\begin_inset Formula $f=1/\sqrt{3\mathcal{H}}$
\end_inset

 to obtain that 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\pi}\left(f\alpha\right)+\partial_{\varphi}\left(f\beta\right)=-1$
\end_inset

.
 Which implies that the limit cycle is not possible, provided the conditions
 of the Bendixson–Dulac theorem are satisfied.
 In particular, the relevant assumption there was that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left(\varphi,\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(\varphi,\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 are smooth - i.e.
 that the flat space Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 is smooth.
 Hence a limit cycle is not possible for k-essence with a smooth Hamiltonian.
 Moreover, one can expect that the 
\emph on
cosmocanonical
\emph default
 system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Therefore we expect that the limit cycle in an expanding universe is only

 Note that both ellipses

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}=0$

 For

 the speed of sound is never superluminal.
 By approaching this singular ellipse 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 from inside the sound speed grows without any limit.
 It is important that configurations with superluminality are separated
 from a possible limit cycle by the singularity ellipse 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Indeed, no physically relevant trajectory can cross this border 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 which is located outside of the singularity ellipse.
 In the region of the phase space between the PD

 and the singularity ellipse 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

 the sound speed is imaginary and the equation of motion (including perturbation
s) is an elliptic PDE.
 The increment of this linear instability grows for each mode without any
 bound by approaching the singularity ellipse 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The linear instability for high

 modes was mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, albeit the authors used a different formula for the sound speed.
 Namely it was assumed that one can treat the system as a perfect fluid
 so that the sound speed can be inferred from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}^{2}=\partial\left\langle p\right\rangle /\partial\left\langle \varepsilon\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 where the averaging is done over many oscillations.
 Clearly this formula is different from

and the dimensionless Newtons constant is 
\begin_inset Formula

G_{\text{N}}=\frac{m^{2}}{M_{\text{Pl}}^{2}}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Under the natural assumptions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{\text{N}}\ll1\,.
\]

\end_inset

The advantage of this auxiliary system is that the singular ellipse 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,u}=0$
\end_inset

, does not correspond to a singularity anymore.
 In generic case when 
\begin_inset Formula $a\neq b\neq1$
\end_inset

 the dynamical flow 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}=\left(\dot{v},\dot{u}\right)$
\end_inset

 across the singular ellipse is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $u$

 is always pointing outside of the singular ellipse, as the positive cosmologica

\begin_inset Formula $-p_{,X}u\sqrt{3G_{\text{N}}\varepsilon}$

 dominates.
 However, by approaching the

\end_inset

-axis along the singular ellipse the second term in the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 starts to dominate, as 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 is vanishing.
 And the direction of flow changes inwards.
 On the singular ellipse, the points of equilibrium between these two forces
 on the right hand side of the first equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 are nontrivial fixed points of the auxiliary system.
 As we discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Nontrivial-fixed-points"

\end_inset

 such fixed points can be either a saddle or a center (at the linear approximati

 Due to the symmetry

\end_inset

 of the system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 there are always at least two such nontrivial fixed points.
 Thus the system has at least five fixed points in total, on top of those

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon\left(X,Y\right)=3X^{2}+3aY^{2}+6bXY-X-Y+\Lambda+\frac{1}{12a}\,.

\end_inset

This quadratic form has an extremum at 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{m}=\frac{1}{6}\left(\frac{a-b}{a-b^{2}}\right)\:\:\text{and}\:\:Y_{m}=\frac{1}{6}\left(\frac{1-b}{a-b^{2}}\right)\,.\label{eq:extremum_XY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This extremum exists in real 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

either if 
\begin_inset Formula

or for the special case when 
\begin_inset Formula $b=1$

\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

 In this extremum 
\begin_inset Formula

The matrix of second derivatives has the form 
\begin_inset Formula

\varepsilon_{,XY} & \varepsilon_{,YY}
\end{array}\right)=6\left(\begin{array}{cc}

\end_inset

This matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon''$

 In that case extremum

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula

so that the linearized system

 takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}

 & \frac{dv}{dt}=-u\,,\nonumber

\end_inset

with the corresponding eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{\pm}^{f}=\sqrt{\frac{3V_{0}}{4}}\pm\sqrt{\frac{3V_{0}}{4}-1}\,.
\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\geq4/3$
\end_inset

 both eigenvalues are real and positive so that the fixed point is an unstable
 node.
 While for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}<4/3$
\end_inset

 both roots are complex with a positive real part so that the fixed point
 is an unstable focus.
 In both cases continuum of trajectories originate from the trivial fixed

True Vacua:

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us consider other fixed points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\pm\left(3a\right)^{-1/2},0\right)$
\end_inset

 which are the true vacua of the potential.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $a<b$
\end_inset

 these fixed points are located outside of the PD and of the Singularity.
 In this case the Lagrangian starts around them from the usual kinetic term
 and these points are indeed stable true vacua.
 Whereas for 
\begin_inset Formula $b<a$
\end_inset

 these fixed points are inside of these ellipses, the Lagrangian starts
 with the wrong-sing kinetic term, and the system behaves as a ghost condensate
 with potential.
 In this case these points should be unstable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the energy we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon=\Lambda+\mathcal{O}\left(\delta u^{2},\delta v^{2}\right)\,,

so that the linearized system 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \frac{du}{dt}=-u\left(\frac{b}{a}-1\right)\sqrt{3G_{\text{N}}\Lambda}-2\delta v\,,\label{eq:nontrivial_fixed_point}\\
 & \frac{d\delta v}{dt}=u\left(\frac{b}{a}-1\right)\,.\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

The corresponding eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\pm}^{t}=\frac{\sqrt{3G_{\text{N}}\Lambda}}{2}\left[\left(1-\frac{b}{a}\right)\pm\sqrt{\left(1-\frac{b}{a}\right)^{2}+\frac{8}{3G_{\text{N}}\Lambda}\left(1-\frac{b}{a}\right)}\right]\,.\label{eq:eigenvalues_true_vacuum}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Further we will neglect the fine-tuned and degenerate case when 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b$
\end_inset

 so that the true vacua are located on the Singularity.
 We only consider simple fixed points where the linear analysis is applicable,
 for this degenerate case see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fig:Limit_2"

\end_inset

.
 Both eigenvalues are real provided either 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a>b\,,\label{eq:true_vac_saddle}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b>a\left(1+\frac{8}{3\Lambda G_{\text{N}}}\right)\,.\label{eq:true_vac_node}

\end_inset

 In the first case 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{+}^{t}>0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{-}^{t}<0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence both these fixed points are saddle points in this case.
 Thus in this case the true vacua are inside of the PD and the Singularity
 and they are always unstable saddle points with the Poincar

 In the second case the true vacua are outside the PD and the Singularity
 and separated from them at least by the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(3a\right)^{-1/2}\left(1-\left(1+8/\left(3\Lambda G_{\text{N}}\right)\right)^{-1/2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In this case both roots 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\pm}^{t}$
\end_inset

 are negative, so that and the true vacua are stable nodes with the Poincar

 the eigenvalues are

\]

\end_inset

Hence, for vanishing Newton constant and 
\begin_inset Formula $a<b$
\end_inset

 both true vacua are centers, whereas for 
\begin_inset Formula $b<a$
\end_inset

 these points are inside of the Singularity and they are saddles and therefore
 unstable.
 For this reason one cannot consider them as a really true vacua in this
 case.

First we can search for the root close to 
\begin_inset Formula $v=0$
\end_inset

.
 The polynomial equation above has the following approximate root 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & v_{s}^{2}=G_{\text{N}}\,\frac{1}{27}\left[\frac{12\Lambda+\left(a^{-1}-1\right)}{\left(b-1\right)^{2}}\right]\times\label{eq:Nontrivial_root}\\

\end{align}

\end_inset

which satisfies this equation up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(G_{N}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 inclusively and vanishes in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\text{N}}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 For the existence of this root one has to require only the positivity of
 the energy density on the Singularity close to the 
\begin_inset Formula $v=0$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon\left(0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)=\Lambda+\frac{1}{12a}-\frac{1}{12}\geq0\,.
\]

\end_inset

Clearly the asymptotic expansion breaks down when 
\begin_inset Formula $b\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 The existence of this root is entirely do to gravity.
 Thus in the leading order in 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\text{N}}$

 the corresponding fixed points are either 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 Hence a limiting cycle is possible around a Singularity.

 For each value energy density these contours are plane algebraic curves

 If we find an energy level completely enclosing the PD from the outside

\end_inset

 (so that in this model

 too) the dynamical flow in an expanding universe will be directed to the
 interior phase space of this level of the energy density.
 Indeed, the normal to the

 contour is 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{N}=\left(\varepsilon_{,v},\varepsilon_{,u}\right)$

\end_inset

 touches the PD at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,\pm1\right)$
\end_inset

 In the physical units, this energy density is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon'_{U}=\Lambda'+\frac{1}{12a'}+\frac{1}{4}m^{4}=m^{4}\left(\Lambda+\frac{1}{12a}+\frac{1}{4}\right)\,.\label{eq:Physical_Energy_Density_Last}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To avoid strong quantum gravity effects one has to require 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon'_{U}\ll M_{\text{Pl}}^{4}$
\end_inset

.
 For positive parameters this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ll M_{\text{Pl}}$
\end_inset

, and consequently the smallness of the dimensionless Newtons constant 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{N}=\frac{m^{2}}{M_{\text{Pl}}^{2}}\ll1\,.
\]

\end_inset

Moreover, for the dimensionless parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 we have the condition 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a\gg\frac{m^{4}}{M_{\text{Pl}}^{4}}=G_{N}^{2}\,.
\]

\end_inset

For the pressure we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p=2Xp_{,X}-\varepsilon_{U}\,.

\end_inset

Now let us check when the energy level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{U}$
\end_inset

, given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:E_U"

\end_inset

, can cross the PD somewhere else at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon\left(v_{*},\sqrt{1-3bv_{*}^{2}}\right)=\varepsilon_{U}\,,
\]

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{4}\left(1-3bv_{*}^{2}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{2}v_{*}^{2}+\frac{3a}{4}v_{*}^{4}=\frac{1}{4}\,,
\]

\end_inset

so that generically there is another root given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{*}^{2}=\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1+3b}{a+3b^{2}}\right)\,.
\]

\end_inset

However, the projection of the PD 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $v-$
\end_inset

axes only occupies 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{2}\leq1/3b$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{*}^{2}>\frac{1}{3b}\,,
\]

\end_inset

the energy level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{U}$
\end_inset

 does not cross the PD.
 Hence the condition for no crossing of the PD is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1+3b}{a+3b^{2}}\right)>\frac{1}{3b}\,,
\]

\end_inset

or in other terms
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
3b^{2}-6b+a-2<0\,.\label{eq:no_second_touch}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The roots of the left hand side of the last inequality are
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b_{0\pm}=1\pm\sqrt{1+\frac{2-a}{3}}\,,
\]

\end_inset

so that there is no more crossings provided 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
1-\sqrt{\frac{5-a}{3}}<b<1+\sqrt{\frac{5-a}{3}}\,.\label{eq:condition_on_b_no_crossing}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In particular, for 
\begin_inset Formula $a>5$

 there are no real roots 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}$
\end_inset

 of the left hand side of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and the energy density level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{U}$
\end_inset

 crosses the PD at four points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\pm v_{*},\pm\sqrt{1-3bv_{*}^{2}}\right)$
\end_inset

 after touching it at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,\pm1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, in that case, energy density level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{U}$
\end_inset

 does not confine the PD.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the energy level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{U}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v_{V}^{2}=\frac{1}{-1+\sqrt{1+3a}}\,.\label{eq:Ev_crossing_phi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is outside of the projection of the PD if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{V}^{2}>\frac{1}{3b}\,,

\end_inset

which translates into inequality 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b>\frac{1}{3}\left(-1+\sqrt{1+3a}\right)=b_{out}\,.\label{eq:condition_on_b_outside}
\end{equation}

These conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\end_inset

which, for positive 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $a<5$
\end_inset

.
 Further one can check that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{out}>b_{0-}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore we arrive to the condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{U}$
\end_inset

 contains the PD provided
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{3}\left(-1+\sqrt{1+3a}\right)<b<1+\sqrt{\frac{5-a}{3}}\,.\label{eq:Ev_Encloses_PD}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is convenient to reformulate these conditions in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

\begin{eqnarray*}
b<1 & \text{and } & a<2b+3b^{2}\,,

\begin{eqnarray*}
1\leq b<\frac{3+\sqrt{15}}{3} & \text{and } & a<2+6b+3b^{2}\,.

In particular, we obtain that for 
\begin_inset Formula $b>1+\sqrt{5/3}$
\end_inset

 the energy level

 cannot confine the PD.

Further for

 the inequality 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $b<1/3$

Now let us check when 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{S}$
\end_inset

 crosses the Phantom Divide somewhere else except of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\pm\left(3b\right)^{-1/2},0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The condition for crossing is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon\left(v_{pd},\sqrt{1-3bv_{pd}^{2}}\right)=\varepsilon_{s}\,,
\]

\end_inset

so that the additional crossing happens at 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{pd}^{2}=\frac{3b^{2}+2b-a}{3b\left(a+3b^{2}\right)}\,.
\]

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{pd}^{2}<0$
\end_inset

 and there is no additional crossing of the PD.
 Thus, for parameters satisfying 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 the energy level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{S}$
\end_inset

 encloses the PD.

Depending on the parameters either 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{U}$

 or

Now let us find for which rages of parameters the energy density level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{S}$
\end_inset

 encloses the Singularity 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Singularity_ellipse"

\end_inset

.
 Let us first find whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{S}$
\end_inset

 can cross the Singularity.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon\left(v_{sin},\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}-bv_{sin}^{2}}\right)=\varepsilon_{s}\,,
\]

\end_inset

which yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{sin}^{2}=\frac{2b-b^{2}-a}{3b\left(a-b^{2}\right)}\,.
\]

\end_inset

This crossing of the Singularity does not happen provided either when 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{sin}^{2}<0$
\end_inset

 i.e when 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
b\leq1 & \text{and} & a<b^{2}\,,\label{eq:v_sing_imaginary_1}\\
b\leq1 & \text{and} & a>2b-b^{2}\,,\label{eq:v_sing_imaginary_2}\\
b>1 & \text{and} & a>b^{2}\,,\label{eq:v_sing_imaginary_3}\\
b>1 & \text{and} & a<2b-b^{2}\,,\label{eq:v_sing_imaginary_4}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

or when 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{sin}^{2}>\left(3b\right)^{-1}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
b<1 & \text{and} & b^{2}<a<b\,,\\
b>1 & \text{and} & b<a<b^{2}\,.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

On the other hand, as we discussed before, if we require a double crossing
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $u-$
\end_inset

axes (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{S}$
\end_inset

 consists of one piece) we have to demand that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a>2b\,.
\]

\end_inset

We should also require that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{S}$
\end_inset

 crosses the 
\begin_inset Formula $u-$
\end_inset

axes at 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{S+}^{2}=\frac{b+\sqrt{b^{2}-2b+a}}{3b}>\frac{1}{3}\,,
\]

\end_inset

which gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
b\leq2 & \text{and} & a>2b-b^{2}\,,\\
b>2 & \text{and} & a>0\,.
\end{eqnarray*}

 from the ghosts instabilities due to interactions (e.g.
 unavoidable interactions through gravity).
 This trivial vacuum is isolated by the red ellipse of the infinitely strong
 coupling from the oscillatory attractor which can be considered as a nontrivial
 ground state.
 However, this is nontrivial ground state is plagued by linear instabilities.
 Indeed, the yellow cyclic trajectory clearly crosses the green ellipse
 four times - enters twice the region where the sound speed is imaginary.
 Moreover, the classical evolution breaks down by approaching the green

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions and Discussion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new oscillatory state of cosmological matter corresponds to a limit
 cycle of the classical equations of motion.
 This state can also be considered as a cosmological realization of a time-cryst
al.
 This regime can be of interest to cosmology, because on average the universe
 undergoes the de Sitter expansion with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle w\right\rangle =-1$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, a time-crystal can be used to model early stages of Inflation or
 late stages of Dark Energy.
 We have shown that any realization of the new oscillatory state of cosmological
 matter requires not only a violation of the NEC but also a crossing of
 the Phantom Divide.
 The systems studied in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bains:2015gpv"

\end_inset

 are known to be incapable to achieve this crossing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vikman:2004dc"

\end_inset

, see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and for a review 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cai:2009zp,Nesseris:2006er"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, the crossing generically implies gradient instabilities
 where the sound speed is imaginary, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}^{2}<0$
\end_inset

.
 We have showed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Refreshing-k-essence-and"

\end_inset

 that the quantum perturbations of k-essence on short scales grow without
 any bound in an attempt to evolve across 
\begin_inset Formula $w=-1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:General-phase-space"

\end_inset

 we used the Bendixson–Dulac theorem to prove that for k-essence i) to realize
 a cosmological limit cycle classically the system has to have a flat-space
 Hamiltonian with cusps and that ii) the existence of a limit cycle implies
 that the system has a singularity where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 changes sign and where the canonical momentum does not define the velocity
 uniquely.
 The appearance of this singularity implies the presence of configurations
 with strong superluminal propagation of the small perturbations and existence
 of other configurations with strong gradient instability.
 On this singularity the small quantum perturbations are infinitely strongly
 coupled.
 The Bendixson–Dulac theorem dictates that the singularity curve on which
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{,X}$
\end_inset

 is vanishing, should be located inside of the limit cycle, as the latter
 cannot cross the singularity.
 For some systems, including the one studied in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bains:2015gpv"

\end_inset

, the configurations with superluminality are separated from the limit cycle
 by the singularity curve with infinitely strongly coupled perturbations.
 Thus one can consider that the oscillatory solution and the superluminal
 configurations are described by two separate EFT's.
 There are arguments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Adams:2006sv"

\end_inset

 that the presence of superluminality implies that the system cannot be
 UV-completed in the usual local and Lorentz-invariant way.
 If the superluminal configurations should be described by a disconnected
 EFT different from the one which describes the limit cycle and neighboring
 configurations these arguments would not apply.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Particular_Model"

\end_inset

 we analyzed in details the dynamics of the particular class of k-essence
 models from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bains:2015gpv"

\end_inset

.
 These theories have three free parameters.
 Following the spirit of the Poincare-Bendixson theorem we analyzed for
 which values of the parameters the limit cycle is possible.
 This section serves for the illustrative purposes of our analytical results
 from the previous sections.
 We provide numerically obtained phase plots for a better visualization.
 In this particular class of theories the configurations with the superluminalit
y are always screened by the singularity from the time-crystal or limit
 cycle.
 However, the latter is also disconnected from the trivial Lorentz-invariant
 vacuum.
 Hence the EFT describing the time-crystal does not have any Lorentz-invariant
 solutions.
 It is interesting to understand under which conditions this feature allows
 for the theory to have a Lorentz-invariant and local UV-completion.

\begin_layout Standard
The models which can violate NEC and can cross the Phantom Divide without
 immediate pathologies are Generalized Galileons / Horndeski theories 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Horndeski,Deffayet:2011gz,Kobayashi:2011nu"

\end_inset

.
 Recently it has been argued 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Libanov:2016kfc"

\end_inset

 that for the subclass of these theories introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Deffayet:2010qz"

\end_inset

 it is still rather hard to have a singularity free cosmological evolution
 without any pathology and with an NEC-violating phase.
 Further these results were generalized to whole class of Horndeski theories
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kobayashi:2016xpl"

\end_inset

.
 Both these works only consider external matter which does not have any
 direct coupling to the considered Galileon scalar field.
 May be a presence of an additional degree of freedom particularly coupled
 to the Galileon can ameliorate the problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude, we find the idea of cosmological time-crystals rather interesting,
 but it seems to be very hard to realize this idea in a physically plausible
 way.
